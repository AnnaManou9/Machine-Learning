# Machine-Learning
Sample scripts of the ML project I was part of during my internship in the National Observatory of Athens. The project includes cleaning of the available data based on physical limits and values, also tackling imbalance problems before used. ML routines like classification and decision trees are used to group the data based on different criteria.
